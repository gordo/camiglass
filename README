2010 May 15. Camiglass, a Firefox theme.

A bit of lovely white glass for those a bit tired of the monotony of stormy gray metal plastic buttons to match gray backgrounds.

This theme uses GrApple Yummy 3.0.1 as a foundation (courtesy of Aronnax), which itself included artwork by Stephen Horlander with contributions by Kevin Gerich. I expanded beyond the original back, forth, reload, stop, and home buttons to create glassy buttons for the rest of the buttons in the navigational and bookmark organizer toolbars. Standing on the shoulders of giants. Enjoy!

Tested on Firefox 3.6.3 on Mac OS X 10.6.3. Currently supporting Firefox 3.6.x and greater on Mac OS X. More support to come when time permits.
